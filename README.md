a.	App Description
Refactoring is a technique of restructuring existing code easy to read, easier to debug by other web developers in team and cheaper to modify, while maintaining its external behavior of the existing code. In my opinion we should be mindful while improving existing code quality by incorporating the popular concept of coding that Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY), make the code meets accessibility standards as well as webpage fully optimized for search engines. 

So, you may be asking how did you meet the user story and acceptance criteria for this existing webpage. First, I incorporated Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) web standards specification written by the W3C, describing a set of additional HTML attributes that can be applied to elements to provide supplementary semantics and improve accessibility wherever it is missing for special people with disabilities. 

In recent years, as various industries make amazing advancements in technology, there has been an increasing demand for professionals’ web code developers who are skilled in new web technologies like html Semantics, flexbox, bootstrap etc. By, keeping in mind the user experience I replaced most of the DIVs with html semantics Elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>. 
First, it is much cooler to read. The easier it is to read and comprehend that code, the easier it makes your job. It has better accessibility. Users are not the only one that finds semantic elements easier to understand. Search engines and assistive technologies (like screen readers for users with a sight impairment) are also able to better grasp the context and content of your website, meaning a healthier experience for your users. Overall, semantic elements also lead to more consistent code. 

As you know the before the refactoring of existing code the current webpage was not responsive al all on all devices, so I did make the webpage fully responsive for all devices resolutions by adding css3 media quarries to the code. So, I used css3 media quarries for different devices like mobile, tablet, desktop etc. to achieve the goals of making the webpage fully responsive. 

On top of that, I added a mobile friendly navigation menu called hamburger menu for small screen devices. When you start shrinking the webpage it will be adjusting per the screen viewport.
